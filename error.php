		<h1>Oops, something went wrong.</h1>
		<p>
		Once upon a midnight dreary,</br>
		While I toiled, weak and weary,</br>
		Over many a quaint and curious homework problems galore.</br>
		</p><p>
		While I nodded, nearly napping,</br>
		Suddenly, there came a warning,</br>
		And my heart was filled with mourning,</br>
		Mourning for my dear amour.</br>
		</p><p>
		'Tis not possible!, I pleaded,</br>
		But my browser, so conceited,</br>
		Remained blank, I then repeated,</br>
		Just a blank and nothing more.</br>
		</p><p>
		With a scream, I was defeated,</br>
		For my files were deleted,</br>
		So I begged, no longer seated,</br>
		Please let me these files reco'er!</br>
		</p><p>
		Then, in answer to my query,</br>
		Through the net I loved so dearly,</br>
		Came its answer, dark and dreary:</br>
		Quoth the server, 404.</br>
		</p>
